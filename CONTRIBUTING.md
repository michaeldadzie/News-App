## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Meals App, please start a discussion by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/michaeldadzie/Meals-App/issues/new) first. It helps me understand your proposal and discuss wether it is necessary or not.

Alternatively, you can help by resolving any of the already [open issues](https://github.com/michaeldadzie/Meals-App/issues).

-   Make your changes and apply [dartfmt](https://dart.dev/tools/dartfmt) on the Dart code.
-   Commit all changes to your fork.
-   Send the PR from `{your-username}/Meals-app:{your-branch-name}` to `michaeldadzie/Meals-app:master`
