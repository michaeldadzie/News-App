## Soulll News

Soulll News is a news app built with Flutter and inspired by [Apple News](https://www.apple.com/apple-news/). 
Soulll News is powered by [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) for news articles


## Features

- Browse articles from many sources, made possible by the [newsapi.org API](https://newsapi.org).
- Read and share articles.

## Building

To build and run the app on your device, do the following:

-   [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install/) by following the instructions on their website.
-   Fork/clone this repo to your computer using `https://github.com/michaeldadzie/News-App.git`.
-   Create a News API Account at [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org), create a secret.dart file in the lib folder and place your key in it (String apiKey = "apikey")
-   Connect your devices/emulators and run the app using `flutter run` in the root of the project directory.
